5/5

Prof. Dawson is a very enthusiastic professor. I think that his teaching style is hands-off, but his grading adapts for that.

He is not afraid to both teach hands-on and make more learned students help people with setting up things, i.e. VirtualBox. This is great!

Often times our requirements are not too strict, and he will attempt to interpret your work in a fair way if something is off-spec.

He likes to cover a far and wide range of materials and it allows us to get a feel for various tools and themes in cyber security.

## Course

5/5

This course helped me deepen my understanding of cybersecurity with a global lens. 

It made me realize that gov'ts, WGOs, terrorists, private and public organizations are all using the tools that we are interacting with.

It gave me perspective on my training and knowledge, and helped me think about what the best thing would be to focus on with regards to future career options.
