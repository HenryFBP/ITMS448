FINAL RESULTS:

out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/src/hardware/serialport/softmodem.h:124:  [5] (buffer) gets:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Use fgets() instead.
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/src/shell/shell_misc.cpp:251:  [5] (buffer) strncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, snprintf,
  or automatically resizing strings. Risk is high; the length parameter
  appears to be a constant, instead of computing the number of characters
  left.
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/src/shell/shell_misc.cpp:252:  [5] (buffer) strncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, snprintf,
  or automatically resizing strings. Risk is high; the length parameter
  appears to be a constant, instead of computing the number of characters
  left.
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/include/cross.h:37:  [4] (format) snprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/include/cross.h:37:  [4] (format) _snprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/include/cross.h:38:  [4] (format) vsnprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/include/dos_system.h:75:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/include/dos_system.h:232:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:

out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/src/cpu/callback.cpp:135:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:

  easily misused).
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/src/debug/debug.cpp:198:  [4] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or
  vsnprintf.
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/src/debug/debug.cpp:206:  [4] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or
  vsnprintf.
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/src/debug/debug.cpp:211:  [4] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or
  vsnprintf.
out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/src/debug/debug.cpp:218:  [4] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or

out/dosbox/dosbox-0.74-3/src/debug/debug.cpp:222:  [4] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or
